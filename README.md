# Life Expectancy Forecasting

###  ABSTRACT 

Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health. Here analyzing a data set of the World Development Indicators (WDI) and proposing a best model to predict the life expectancy in 2019. The project entails utilising R to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the provided data set.The work has developed a variety of methodologies, including Mallow's cp, linear regression, and imputed data. Several R libraries approaches was presented. As a result, the analysis offers a full comprehension of the various issues associated with the employment of statistical modelling and experimental approaches. In this 
way, the entire analysis of the required task has been carried out, and pertinent information has been drawn in an appropriate manner. Finally the differences in life expectancy across a single factor continent have been done using ANOVA one way method.
